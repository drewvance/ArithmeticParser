# ArithmeticParser

Code accompanying a recent talk that demonstrates how to build a parser.

# Potential Additions (left to the audience)
 - Allow decimals (2.555)
 - Allow commas (2,857)
 - Allow mod (4 % 3)
 - Allow negation of expressions… i.e. -(4+2)
 - Fix part of code that uses ‘int()’
 - Allow “short” expressions (34), and long expressions, (34 + 54 - 87 / 21 *999)
